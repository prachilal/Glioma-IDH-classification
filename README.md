# Glioma-IDH-classification

 Identifying gliomas, a type of brain tumor, based on the presence of a specific genetic mutation called IDH.

# Introduction

The IDH mutation is a useful biomarker for brain tumor identification because it is present in the majority of low-grade gliomas and secondary high-grade gliomas, while it is absent in primary high-grade gliomas and normal brain tissues. Thus, IDH testing can aid in diagnosing and classifying gliomas, which is important for determining appropriate treatment options and predicting patient outcomes.

# Data Collection

The dataset consists of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain tumors, along with their corresponding IDH mutation status.
